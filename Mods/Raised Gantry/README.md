This Mode raises the gantry of the Shapeoko 5 pro by three inches. This is particularly handy if you are installing an ATC tool rack and would like to retain the cutting area. 

This is a exact bolt in replacement, if you would like to use the stock drag chains, there are holes to enable you to mount them high or low. This mod also retains the ability to move the gantry to the front position. 


Stock drag chain mount holes.
