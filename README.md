- Raised gantrys: This modification raises the gantry by three inches. Particularly useful if you plan on installing an ATC Spindle.

- Reverse Drag chaines: This modification repositions the drag chains so that the cables come out the front of the machine when using the raised gantry mod. This particularly is useful if you are running into clearence issues when using a dust boot.

- CNCDepot Rear mount Tram mount: This is a set of plates for both mounting and traming a RM series CNCDepot spindles. It uses a common traming mechanism for cnc machines and provides lower and parallel mounting options.

- Pneumatic Dust boot: This mod works with the RM tram mount mod to provide a way to mount a dust boot that is pneumatically controlled.

- PSU Enclosure: This is a enclosure to hold a 24v Meanwell PSU for powering the controller and a 36v Meanwell PSU for powering stepper motors. It also offers a earth ground on the controller connection to ground the chasis. Multiple enclosures can be used if driving high current steppers.

- Power contactor enclosure: This allows both 120vac and 240vac circuits to be controlled remotely. It also provides an E-stop switch so that power can be cut from both circuits at the same time.
