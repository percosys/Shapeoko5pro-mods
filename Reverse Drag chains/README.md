# Shapeoko 5 Pro Reverse Drag chain mod
This mod only works with gantry's that have been raised. For my build I have raised the it by three inches. The raised gantry mod in this repository contains the files needed if you choose to mill your own risers. The purpose of this mod reverses the Y axis drag chains so that the cables exit the machine from the front. This is helpful if you want to mount your controller closer to the front of the machine for easier access. This will elminate the circuit board from the right Y axis cover, so that you can route cables in its space. If you intend to use the stock controller and connections for the bit setter and tool probe, you will need to make extension cables. 

The drag chains I used are 18x25 and use square mounts instead of the tab mounts like the original. They are available on Amazon and you will need four in total (two on each side).  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9QFYJ66

You will also need eight M4 12mm socket head screws to attach the new chains along with eight M4 nuts. The M4 nut retainers are optional, but make it much easier to install. All you have to do is insert the M4 nuts into each retainer (4 in total) and place them in the drag chain connector, then attach on each end with M4 screws. 

Printing the X axis covers can be challenging and requires support. I used PETG, but any filament should work. I would reccomend avoiding anything CF, because the supports can get to be pain to remove.
